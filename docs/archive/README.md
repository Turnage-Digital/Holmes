## Why Archived?

These documents were created during planning but led to fragmentation. The consolidated approach:

1. **Single source of truth** — `PHASE_3_CONSOLIDATED.md` tracks all Phase 3.x work
2. **Less duplication** — Architecture concepts merged into main `ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. **Clear status** — One place to see what's done vs pending

Do not update these files. Update the main docs instead.
